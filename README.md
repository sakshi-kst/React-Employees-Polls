# Employee Polls Web APP

This is a voting application where employees can ask questions with two options, to get the pulse of other colleagues. Not sure if you should hold a sprint retrospective meeting after every release or once every quarter? Employee Polls is the way to go!!

The user can login to the application and add new questions, answer the already existing questions as well as see the results of the polls. What's better? We also have a leaderboard of the top 3 employees with the most number of asked and answered questions!
